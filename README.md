# Sentiment-Analysis
	•	Developed and implemented a sentiment classification system for Yelp reviews using Python, processing a dataset of 10,000 reviews.
	•	Preprocessed and vectorized text data using TF-IDF and Bag of Words techniques to quantify sentiment features.
	•	Applied Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression to classify sentiments, achieving a peak accuracy of 90% with Logistic Regression.
	•	Leveraged the VADER sentiment analysis tool for a lexicon-based approach and compared it with supervised machine learning models.
	•	Conducted exploratory data analysis and generated detailed performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
	•	Predicted sentiment for custom customer reviews using the trained Logistic Regression model and interpreted the classification results.
	•	Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
	•	Key Skills: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Sentiment Analysis.
